Scientific Data,A repository-hosted dataset of volcanic ash particle images and features,"Volcanic ash is made of particles smaller than 2 mm and is produced during volcanic eruptions. Studying the properties of volcanic ash is key for a range of applications, including volcano monitoring. However, given the large variety of textures, colors, and shapes of particles from different eruptions and volcanoes it is challenging to classify them in a reproducible and systematic manner. Here, we present an open access repository-hosted dataset of 11,808 particles from 53 samples across 13 volcanoes. Particle data includes optical microscope images, physical characteristics of the shape, texture and color, and a classification label with the particle type (free-crystal, altered material, juvenile or lithic). The dataset has already been used to develop particle classifiers with Machine Learning. We plan to continue it to grow and encourage the volcano community to contribute towards standardizing volcanic ash classification.",2025-04-23,10.1038/s41597-025-04942-9,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04942-9,Hamdi Rifai,
Scientific Data,Single Molecule Localization Super-resolution Dataset for Deep Learning with Paired Low-resolution Images,"Deep learning super-resolution microscopy has advanced rapidly in recent years. Super-resolution images acquired by single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) are ideal sources for high-quality datasets. However, the scarcity of public datasets limits the development of deep learning methods. Here, we describe a biological image dataset, DL-SMLM, which provides paired low-resolution fluorescence images and super-resolution SMLM data for training super-resolution models. DL-SMLM consists of six different subcellular structures, including microtubules, lumen and membrane of endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Clathrin coated pits (CCPs), outer membrane of mitochondria (OMM) and inner membrane of mitochondria (IMM). There are 188 sets of raw SMLM data and 100 signal levels for each low-resolution image. This allows software developers to generate thousands of training pairs through data segmentation. The performance of the imaging system was further evaluated using DNA origami samples. Finally, we demonstrated examples of super-resolution models trained using data from DL-SMLM, highlighting the effectiveness of DL-SMLM for developing deep learning super-resolution microscopy.",2025-04-23,10.1038/s41597-025-04979-w,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04979-w,Wei Ji,
Scientific Data,HindwingLib: A library of leaf beetle hindwings generated by Stable Diffusion and ControlNet,"The utilization of datasets from beetle hindwings is prevalent in research of morphology and evolution of beetles, serving as a valuable tool for comprehending the evolutionary processes and functional adaptations under specific environmental conditions. However, the collection of hindwing images of beetles poses several challenges, including limited sample availability, complex sample preparation procedures, and restricted public accessibility. Recently, a machine learning technique called Stable Diffusion has been developed to statistically generate diverse images using a pretrained model with prompts. In this study, we introduce an approach utilizing Stable diffusion and ControlNet for the generation of beetle hindwing images, along with the corresponding results obtained from its application to a diverse set of 200 leaf beetle hindwings. To demonstrate the fidelity of the synthetic hindwing images, we conducted a comprarative analysis of three key metrics: Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), Inception Score (IS), and Fréchet Inception Distance (FID), which are crucial for evaluating image fidelity. The results demonstrated a strong alignment between the actual data and the synthetic images, confirming their high fidelity. This novel library of leaf beetle hindwings not only offers morphological image for utilization in machine learning, but also showcases the extensive applicability of the proposed methodology.",2025-04-23,10.1038/s41597-025-05010-y,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-05010-y,SiQin Ge,

Scientific Data,A benchmarking framework and dataset for learning to defer in human-AI decision-making,"Learning to Defer (L2D) algorithms improve human-AI collaboration by deferring decisions to human experts when they are likely to be more accurate than the AI model. These can be crucial in high-stakes tasks like fraud detection, where false negatives can cost victims their life savings. The primary challenge in training and evaluating these systems is the high cost of acquiring expert predictions, often leading to the use of simplistic simulated expert behavior in benchmarks. We introduce OpenL2D, a framework generating synthetic experts with adjustable decision-making processes and work capacity constraints for more realistic L2D testing. Applied to a public fraud detection dataset, OpenL2D creates the financial fraud alert review dataset (FiFAR), which contains predictions from 50 fraud analysts for 30 K instances. We show that FiFAR’s synthetic experts are similar to real experts in metrics such as consistency and inter-expert agreement. Our L2D benchmark reveals that performance rankings of L2D algorithms vary significantly based on the available experts, highlighting the need to consider diverse expert behavior in L2D benchmarking.",2025-04-23,10.1038/s41597-025-04664-y,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-04664-y,Pedro Bizarro,

Earth System Science Data,An operational SMOS soil freeze-thaw product,". The Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite is a valuable tool for monitoring global soil freeze-thaw dynamics, particularly in high-latitude environments where these processes are important for understanding ecosystem and carbon cycle dynamics. This paper introduces the updated SMOS Level-3 (L3) Soil Freeze-Thaw (FT) product and details its threshold-based classification algorithm, which utilizes L band passive microwave measurements to detect soil freeze-thaw transitions; this is possible due to the difference in dielectric properties between frozen and thawed soils at this frequency band. The algorithm applies gridded brightness temperature data from the SMOS satellite, augmented with ancillary datasets of air temperature and snow cover, to generate global estimates of freeze-thaw state. A recent update to the algorithm includes improved noise reduction through temporal filtering. Validation results against in-situ soil moisture and temperature measurements and comparisons to ERA5 Land reanalysis data demonstrate the ability of the product to detect the day of first freezing, an important metric for better understanding greenhouse gas fluxes and ecosystem dynamics, with improved accuracy. How- ever, limitations remain, particularly in regions affected by radio frequency interference (RFI) and during spring melt periods when wet snow hinders soil thaw detection. Despite these challenges, the SMOS FT product provides crucial data for carbon cycle studies, particularly in relation to methane fluxes, as soil freezing affects methane emissions in high-latitude regions.",2025-04-22,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-2025-68,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-2025-68,Unknown,

Earth System Science Data,The complete 3-year dataset of 4STAR sky-scans from ORACLES 2016–2018,". The NASA ORACLES (ObseRvations of Aerosols above CLouds and their intEractionS) airborne field campaigns deployed a 4STAR (Spectrometer for Sky-Scanning, Sun-Tracking Atmospheric Research) instrument onboard a P-3 aircraft to measure columnar optical properties of biomass burning aerosol smoke plumes over the Southeast Atlantic Ocean from 2016 to 2018. Although 4STAR’s retrievals of aerosol optical properties from direct solar irradiances and diffuse sky radiances were performed, analyzed, and compared against other field campaigns via Single Scattering Albedo (SSA) campaign medians by Pistone et al., 2019 for ORACLES 2016, such an analysis was not extended to 2017 and 2018 due to previously unquantified instrument performance issues. As a result, only the 4STAR 2016 dataset was available to the public via https://doi.org/10.5067/Suborbital/ORACLES/P3/2016_V3 (ORACLES Science Team, 2021a). The instrument issues were diagnosed and mitigated through use of a four-wavelength set, instead of the previous five-wavelength set. Uniform Quality Control (QC) standards were established to ensure consistent data quality across all three campaigns. This resulted in research-quality, four-wavelength 4STAR datasets for 2017 and 2018 that have since been archived along with the original five-wavelength 4STAR 2016 dataset on the NASA Earth Science Project Office website, replacing the older versions at https://doi.org/10.5067/Suborbital/ORACLES/P3/2017_V3 (ORACLES Science Team, 2021b) and https://doi.org/10.5067/Suborbital/ORACLES/P3/2018_V3 (ORACLES Science Team, 2021c). The four-wavelength 4STAR 2016 dataset, although not on the archival site, is also publicly available via https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14659686 (Mitchell, 2025). Potential improvements to these initial releases, such as broadening the spectral range, substituting for missing flight-level albedo, and removing unreliable scattering angles, are discussed. The complete 3-year ORACLES 4STAR 2016–2018 has many uses, including the determination of subseasonal changes in aerosol properties, modelling aerosol evolution, and the validation of satellite-retrieved aerosol products.",2025-04-17,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-2025-31,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-2025-31,Unknown,

Earth System Science Data,Monitoring CO2 in diverse European cities: Highlighting needs and challenges through characterisation,". For the development of a joint European capacity for monitoring CO2 emissions, we created the framework ""CO2 Monitoring Challenges City Mapbooks v1.0"" (acronym CMC-CITYMAP). It includes a Jupyter notebook tool (Storm et al., 2025a, https://doi.org/10.18160/P8SV-B99F) which we use to characterise and cluster cities based on aspects relevant for different CO2 monitoring challenges, including (a) determining background levels of CO2 inflow into a city (""background challenge""), (b) separating the anthropogenic emissions from the influence of the biosphere (""biogenic challenge""), (c) representing spatially and temporally non-uniform emissions in models (""modelling challenge""), and (d) implementing observation strategies not covered by the other challenges (""application-specific observational challenge""). We provide and discuss the challenges city-by-city basis, but our primary focus is on the relationships between cities: best practices and lessons learned from monitoring CO2 emissions in one city can be transferred to other cities with similar characteristics. Additionally, we identify cities with characteristics that strongly contrast with those of cities with existing urban monitoring systems. While the notebook tool includes 308 cities, this paper focuses on the results for 96 cities with more than 200,000 inhabitants, with a particular emphasis on Paris, Munich, and Zurich. These cities are pilot cities for the Horizon 2020-funded project Pilot Application in Urban Landscapes (""ICOS Cities""), where a range of urban CO2 monitoring methods are being implemented and assessed. According to our analyses, Zurich — and Munich especially — should be less challenging to monitor than Paris. Examining the challenges individually reveals that the most significant relative challenge is the ""modelling challenge"" (c) for Zurich and Paris. Complex urban topography adds to the challenge for both cities, and in Zurich, the natural topography further amplifies the challenge. Munich has low scores across all challenges, but with the greatest challenge anticipated from the ""application-specific observational challenge"" (d). Overall, Bratislava (Slovakia) and Copenhagen (Denmark) are among the most distant from Paris, Munich, and Zurich in our dendrogram resulting from numerical cluster-analysis. This makes them strong candidates for inclusion in the ICOS Cities network, as they would potentially provide the most information on how to monitor emissions in cities that face different challenges.",2025-04-14,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-2025-63,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-2025-63,Unknown,

Earth System Science Data,"Observations of surface energy fluxes and meteorology in the seasonally snow-covered high-elevation  East River watershed during SPLASH, 2021–2023","From autumn 2021 through summer 2023, scientists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and partners conducted the Study of Precipitation, the Lower Atmosphere, and Surface for Hydrometeorology (SPLASH) campaign in the East River watershed of Colorado. One objective of SPLASH was to observe the transfer of energy between the atmosphere and the surface, which was done at several locations. Two remote sites were chosen that did not have access to power utilities. These were along the valley floor near the East River in the vicinity of the unincorporated town of Gothic, Colorado. Energy balance measurements were made at these locations using autonomous, single-level flux towers referred to as atmospheric surface flux stations (ASFSs). The ASFSs were deployed on 28 September 2021 at the Kettle Ponds Annex site and on 12 October 2021 at the Avery Picnic site and operated until 19 July and 21 June 2023, respectively. Measurements included basic meteorology; upward and downward longwave and shortwave radiative fluxes and subsurface conductive flux, each at 1âmin resolution; 3-D winds from a sonic anemometer and H2O/CO2 from an open-path gas analyzer, both at 20âHz from which sensible, latent heat, and CO2 fluxes were derived; and profiles of soil properties in the upper 0.5âm (both sites) and temperature profiles through the snow (at Avery Picnic), each reported between 10âmin and 6âh. The system uptime was 97â% (Kettle Ponds) and 90â% (Avery Picnic), and collectively 1184âd of data was obtained between the stations.
